# Soil Moisture Visualization

An interactive physical–digital project that translates real-world soil moisture data into a real-time visual interface using Arduino and p5.js. This project explores how environmental sensor data can be made more legible, intuitive, and engaging through visual design.

## Live Demo

⚠️ **Hardware Note**  
The live demo runs in **Demo Mode** using simulated sensor values.  
The full experience requires an Arduino board and soil moisture sensor connected via serial communication.
This approach ensures the visualization is accessible in a browser while accurately representing the behavior of the real-time system.

## Project Overview

This was a fun class project exploring physical computing and creative coding.  
Using Arduino and a soil moisture sensor, I experimented with translating environmental data into a playful visual language.
The visual elements were illustrated in **Procreate** and brought to life using **p5.js**.
